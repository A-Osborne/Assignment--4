				<p>Vincent van Gogh was the son of a minister in Holland. in 1880, he studied at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, Belgium.</p>
				<p>Van Gogh's art would change in style as the years past. When he started, he painted landscapes and peasants, using very dark tones. During that same time, Impressionism, using vivid colours, was growing in popularity.</p>
				<p>It was in 1885 when he made a painting called, "Potato Eaters", his first major art piece, was when he was getting some interest within the art community. Even though that piece sparked some popularity in his work, it still wasn't enough, and selling his work was still hard. His brother, Theo, knew about his struggles due to vast amounts of letters from Vincent.</p>
				<p>It was only a year later when Vincent moved to Paris, France was when his art style changed for the better. He was meeting up with the likes of Gougin and Monet, which they influenced a change in Vincents artwork. </p>
				<p>After just ten short year into his art career, with countless hospital stays for mental illness, He took his own life in 1890 calling it, "for the good of all.". His artwork is still showcased around the world, making him one of the most influential artists in the world to this day!</p>
